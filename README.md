### Example of the Composite Design Pattern

This example of the Composite Design Pattern pattern was develop using C# language.

This technique allows us to create compound objects, which are objects made up of several other objects, as well as groups of objects that can be a mix of individual and compound objects. By using a single common API, we can interact with these objects uniformly, regardless of whether we are dealing with a single object or a group of objects. This uniformity simplifies the management and manipulation of complex structures. For example, in graphic drawing software, this pattern enables the application to treat individual shapes and groups of shapes (such as layers or composite shapes) in the same way, making it easier to apply transformations, manage properties, and perform rendering consistently across different types of objects. Similarly, in other software that uses layers and groups, this pattern streamlines operations by providing a consistent interface for handling both simple and complex entities.
